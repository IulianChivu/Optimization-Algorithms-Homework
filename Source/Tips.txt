- must read mentioned variables from Input and make them constant afterwards,
you can try to figure that out
- please fix Random.h :((
- you can implement the crossover functions or at least one of them, left you a prototype
- you can continue implementing the algorithm in main
- I did not implement anything related to the parameters that the normal distribution function 
receives in the crossover process
